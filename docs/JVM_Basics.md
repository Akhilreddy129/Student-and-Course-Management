**What is JDK, JRE, JVM?**
JDK (Java Development Kit): A software package that provides tools to develop Java applications (compiler, debugger, libraries).

JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Provides the libraries and JVM needed to run Java programs, but not to develop them.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The engine that executes Java bytecode. It interprets compiled .class files and runs them on any operating system.

**What is Bytecode?**
Bytecode is the intermediate representation of Java code produced after compilation (.class files).

It is platform-independent and understood by the JVM.

**What does “Write Once, Run Anywhere” mean?**
Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any machine that has a JVM.

This means developers don’t need to rewrite code for different operating systems — the same .class file runs on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

This portability is one of Java’s biggest strengths and makes it widely used for cross-platform applications.
